* Why are best and most experienced employees of ABC leaving prematurely.
* Explore the factors that are important to the employees.

* using ggpairs
* using plots
* using clustering (k-means)
* Linear regression to identify factors affecting employees leaving

_Build Model to predict employees Leaving_
* split available data set into training data, validation data and Test data.
* build the predictive model using training data. 
* build both Logistic regression and random forest model.
* validate both the models against against unseen data(validation data) for repeatability of the model
* pick the best model of the two

__Provide Recommendations__
